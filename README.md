# FreeCodeCampProjects


## Overview:
This is a repo to save some of the projects done for the Machine Learning with Python FreeCodeCamp certification. The rest of the projects I have done are avaliable in the certification link. The projects uploaded were chosen as they all require some form of model training which is why the first project in the machine learning course, rock/paper/scissor, was not uploaded here as it did not require model training or parameter tuning.
